## What is HacktoberFest?

What is Hacktoberfest?
Hacktoberfest, in its 8th year, is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean. During the month of October, we invite you to join open-source software enthusiasts, beginners, and the developer community by contributing to open-source projects. You can do this in a variety of ways:

- Prepare and share your project for collaboration
- Contribute to the betterment of a project via pull requests
- Organize an event
- Mentor others
- Donate directly to open source projects

Everyone is invited to participate and contribute regardless of your background or experience. All you need to do is fill the form from link given below and sign-up to participate on the Hacktoberfest website.

Hosted by DigitalOcean for the 8th year in a row, Hacktoberfest encourages participation in giving back to the open source community by completing pull requests, participating in events, and donating to open source projects. 

## Rules
To earn your Hacktoberfest t-shirt or tree reward, you must register and make 4 valid pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone). PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub.
If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.
